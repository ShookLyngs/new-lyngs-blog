I’m ShookLyngs.

Basically, I am a software developer, and I’ve been focusing on frontend development of websites and apps for 3 years.

I like to play with new frontend stuffs, and if you check my contributions on Github, you’ll find that I’m the person who’s always working on something.

I have completed atleast 50 projects this year, and half of them was powered by Vue.js.

It’s not just a market-oriented result, I often choose to use Vue3 as basement when landing outsourcing projects, due to the simplicity of it.

But when I need to develop an app with more native ability, or when I’m gonna make a Mini-program app, Flutter and UniApp should be some better solutions.

Many of my works are private, but anyway, you can review my open-source projects on Github.
